# SuperComplex

SuperComplex is a framework for creating and running swarm AI on distributed mobile devices with different contexts. Unlike traditional AI approaches that focus on large language models, SuperComplex generates many small, independent AI agents that can be hosted on devices as compact as an iPhone.

## Key Features

- **Distributed AI**: Create a swarm of small, independent AI agents that can run on various mobile devices.
- **Context-Aware Agents**: Each agent operates with its own unique context, allowing for diverse problem-solving approaches.
- **Egalitarian Information Handling**: Agents treat information about other agents equally to any other information they discover, promoting a flat, decentralized structure.
- **Python Code Execution**: Agents can write and execute Python code to solve problems or access the internet.
- **Dynamic Information Gathering**: Agents can collect information from the internet and about other agents, saving it to their memory files with equal priority.
- **Cross-Agent Querying**: Agents can accept and respond to questions from other agents in the swarm, with responses treated as general information.

## How It Works

1. **Agent Creation**: SuperComplex generates multiple small AI agents, each with its own context and capabilities.
2. **Distribution**: Agents are distributed across various mobile devices, utilizing the available computing power.
3. **Problem Solving**: When faced with a task, agents can:
   - Attempt to solve it independently
   - Request assistance from other agents (treated as an information source)
   - Execute Python code to gather information or perform actions
   - Access and update their memory files, treating all information equally
4. **Swarm Intelligence**: The collective intelligence of the swarm emerges from the interactions and collaborations between individual agents, with no hierarchical structure.

## Technical Details

- **Primary Language**: The SuperComplex framework is developed entirely in Python.
- **Agent Relationships**: Agents don't maintain a special "friends list". Information about other agents is stored and prioritized the same as any other piece of information.
- **Context and Greed**: An agent's "greed" is part of its context. This context influences how the agent selects actions and searches for information, including information about other agents.
- **Inter-Agent Communication**: Agents communicate directly with each other without a central server, using a peer-to-peer approach. Communication is treated as another form of information gathering.

## Milestones

1. **Basic Agent Functionality**
   - An agent can store and retrieve information in its context
   - An agent can perform basic scheduled actions

2. **Python Code Execution**
   - An agent can write simple Python code

3. **Memory Management**
   - An agent can write data to its memory file
   - An agent can read and retrieve data from its memory file
   - An agent can perform basic indexing and searching of its memory, treating all information equally

4. **Internet Access**
   - An agent can generate Python code to access the internet
   - An agent can execute internet-accessing code safely
   - An agent can store retrieved information in its memory, without distinguishing between internet data and agent data

5. **Inter-Agent Communication**
   - An agent can discover and communicate with other agents
   - An agent can store information received from other agents as general data in its memory
   - An agent can query other agents for information, treating responses as it would any internet-sourced data

6. **Context-Driven Behavior**
   - An agent can make decisions based on its context and "greed"
   - An agent can modify its own context based on new information, regardless of the source
   - An agent can prioritize tasks and information searches based on its context, treating agent-related tasks equally to others

7. **Mobile Deployment**
   - An agent can run on a mobile device (initially iPhone)
   - An agent can operate within resource constraints of a mobile environment
   - Users can manage agents through a simple mobile interface

8. **Collaborative Problem-Solving**
   - Agents can break down complex tasks into subtasks
   - Agents can distribute subtasks among themselves, treating other agents as general problem-solving resources
   - Agents can aggregate results from multiple subtasks to solve complex problems

9. **Natural Language Interaction**
   - An agent can interpret basic natural language queries
   - An agent can generate simple natural language responses
   - Users can interact with agents using natural language inputs

10. **Swarm Intelligence**
    - Agents can form dynamic, non-hierarchical swarms to tackle larger problems
    - Agents can learn from interactions within the swarm, storing this knowledge as general information
    - The swarm can exhibit emergent problem-solving behaviors without central coordination

11. **Beta Release Functionality**
    - Agents can be easily created and deployed by developers
    - Agents can operate reliably in various network conditions
    - Developers can access comprehensive documentation and examples
